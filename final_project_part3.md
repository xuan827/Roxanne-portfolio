# Part III: Final project and presentation
This final project allowed me to apply everything I had learned in the course, explore flourish to create different visualizations, shorthand for creating the data story. The intent of choosing the topic "Make ITEqual" was to pick up something that mattered to me. This entire process has been educative, interesting and enlightning. From soliciting feedback from different people, to preparing a 1 min presentation of something that took weeks of work was definitely exciting.
