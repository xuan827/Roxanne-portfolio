# Part III: Final project and presentation
This final project allowed me to apply everything I had learned in the course, explore flourish to create different visualizations, shorthand for creating the data story. The intent of choosing the topic "Make ITEqual" was to pick up something that mattered to me. This entire process has been educative, interesting and enlightning. From soliciting feedback from different people, to preparing a 1 min presentation of something that took weeks of work was definitely exciting.

## Start of my project
[Part-I](final_project.md)

A brainstorming phase - a high level project idea, project structure, initial sketches, data sources.

## Progress of my project
[Part II](final_project_part2.md)

Draft and feedback - I used shorthand to build my story arc and collected feedback through target audiences interview.

## End of my project

The final project can be viewed [here](https://preview.shorthand.com/LnVw0Ebe3I0w92FY?_gl=1*s7cwqf*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE2NDUwNDg4NTYuQ2owS0NRaUEzcktRQmhDTkFSSXNBQ1VFV19ZR1c5QjFhU1d3MUJWVVZsbEpZRnAyMkpHMUF5Wnp1bU41RnhoM0ZBa0dwNFhMRlZxSGlac2FBck9ZRUFMd193Y0I.).

### Audience for my project
I redefine the audience of my project. My audiences are common people in the United Stated with different pet breeding situations instead a vague concepts "everyone". I hope people in U.S., whether he or she has pet or not, can do their best to become the savior of the stray animal crisis, therefore the scope of audience is not targeted at a single specific group，but for a diverse group:"people who are keeping pets now", "people who want to get a pet", "people who don't want pets". The key things that I thought about while revising is whether the story can be well organized and integrated, making sense to every group.

In my story, I talked about "who is the savior of stray animal crisis". Through discussion of possible saviors, different audiences will have empathy engagement. At the same time, in the final appeal, I also put forward different suggestions for different audience roles, so that everyone can take action after listening or reading my story.

Compared with Part II, I also made the classification of discussed sarior clearer. In order to distinguish "pet owners" and "adopters" more effectively, I changed "pet owners" as "pet owners who are keeping pets" in my subtitle.

### Changes I made since the completion of Part II
**Develop my priority list of feedback** 

This is the integrated feedback from interviews in my part 2 submission(using orange stickie) and from professor's feedback(using blue stickie). According to the feasibility and value, I put these feedbacks on the coordinate axis.

**Change based on priority**

Based on the priority, I absorb most of feedbacks and modified my story. But a small number of low priority feedback were not modified due to time constraints. Those gray stickers are the parts that have not been modified.

Now, when I reflect back on the entire journey, I think there are some challenging moments that have benefited me a lot. 

The first chanllege is outline design and data collect. Although I have many topics to talk about or different perspectives on the same topic, collecting comprehensive and sufficient data is a headache. Therefore, I initially determined some outlines, and check whether there is data supporting each part. After several rounds of adjustments, the data and outline were finally determined.

The second chanllege is story design. At first, I'm so obsessed with the adequacy of data that I ignore the story. my story was closer to the stacking of views and data report rather than a story. The professor's comments woke me up in time and Netflix's videos help me a lot. After watching several videos, I learned some method and structure of story telling, so in part II, I reorganized the story structure from a new angle，making the story line clearer and more attractive. 

Collecting feedback and analyzing what needs to be modified is a challenge. Different audiences have different preferences for story and visual appreciation, especially in design aesthetics. Therefore, how to modify the final work in limited time so that most of my target audience can be satisfied is a challenge. Combined with feasibility and importance, I ranked all feedbacks. Generally mentioned issues are listed as the most important and must be modified. Feedbacks that are rarely mentioned and may involve the personal preferences of the audience are given the lowest priority.

Finally, telling a story in 60s is a big chanllenge. Understanding what key elements to include in the presentations, such that it still flows coherently and conveys the overall intent is very difficult. After multiple iterations and practice, I was finally able to do it all under 1 minute.
