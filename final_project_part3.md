# Part III: Final project and presentation
This final project allowed me to apply everything I had learned in the course, explore flourish to create different visualizations, shorthand for creating the data story. The intent of choosing the topic "Make ITEqual" was to pick up something that mattered to me. This entire process has been educative, interesting and enlightning. From soliciting feedback from different people, to preparing a 1 min presentation of something that took weeks of work was definitely exciting.

## Start of my project
[Part-I](final_project.md)

A brainstorming phase - a high level project idea, project structure, initial sketches, data sources.

## Progress of my project
[Part II](final_project_part2.md)

Draft and feedback - I used shorthand to build my story arc and collected feedback through target audiences interview.

## End of my project

### Audience for my project
My audience is everyone with different pet breeding situations in the United State, which is a large scope. I hope everyone, whether he or she has pet or not, can do their best to become the savior of the stray animal crisis, therefore the scope of audience is not targeted at a single specific groupï¼Œbut for a diverse group. The key things that I thought about while revising is whether the story can be well organized and integrated, making sense to every group.

In my story, I talked about "who is the savior of stray animal crisis". Through discussion of possible saviors, different audiences will have empathy engagement. At the same time, in the final appeal, I also put forward different suggestions for different audience roles, so that everyone can take action after listening or reading my story.

Compared with Part II, I made the classification of discussed sarior clearer. In order to distinguish "pet owners" and "adopters" more effectively, I changed "pet owners" as "pet owners who are keeping pets" in my subtitle.

### Changes I made since the completion of Part II
