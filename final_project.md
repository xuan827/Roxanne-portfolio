# The data
## 1. The fact and consequence of stray dogs and cats
### The poor situation of stray dogs and cats in U.S
There are some data related to the statistics of the number of total dogs&cats in U.S and stray dogs in U.S. And I want to use this data to show the poor situation of stray dogs and cats in U.S[1]

## 2. The reasons of high stray dog and cat statistics
### Reason 1: owner surrender
#### Reasons for Owner surrender dogs and cats
There is a survey of why owners surrender dogs and cats, which can used to explain and anlyze the reasons of owner surrender[2]

### Reason 2: Insufficient capacity of shelter
#### Map of the intake number of shelters in differnt state
There are some data related to the intake number of shelters in differnt state, and I want to use this number to explain the capability of stray dogs and cats rescue. The ability of most of the states is not limited.[3]

#### Trend of gross intakes and stray cats & dogs intakes over years
The gross intakes and stray cats & dogs intakes of shelters decreased in recent 2 years caused by Covid 19, which further reflects the insufficient capacity of shelters.[3]

### Reason 3: Low adoption rate
#### The decline trend of adoption number from shelters
The adoption number of Jan-June from 2019 to 2021 shows a decline trend of dogs and cats adoption.[4]

#### How people choose to acquire a pet
There is a survey in 2020 of how people choose to acquire a dog or cat. From this data, it is easy to see using adoption to acquire a pet is still low.[5]

#### People's attitude towards adoption
There is a survey about people's attitude towards adoption. And it can show that wven though people consider adoption, the possibility of adoption finally is low.[6]

### Reason 4: Pet lost
#### Proportion of pets lost 
There are some data related to the number of dogs and cats lost in U.S every year. The proportion of pet lost and cannot find seems not high comapred with all the dogs and cats, but when this number compares with the capacity of shelters, this number is really high.[7]

### Reason 5: Not get spayed or neutered
#### Breeding ability of cats and dogs
This data shows the breeding ability of cats and dogs, which is used to explaine if the cats and dogs are not spayed or neutured, the number of cats and dogs will increase catastrophically.[8]

#### Pet spayed or neutered rate of U.S 
The data will used to show the trend of pet spayed or neutered rate, which declined in recent years.[9-10] 

#### Spayed or neutered rate of cats and dogs received by shelters
This data is used to explain the spayed or neutered rate of cats and dogs received by shelters is low, which means the stray cats and dogs are basically not spayed or neutered. They will breed a large number of offspring outside.[11]

# Method and medium
Step 1: Collecting and reorganizing the datasets. Extract the data from web pages, pdf and csv and organize them into a CSV format, which is easy to visualization

Step 2: Wireframe. Complete the wireframe by pen or with the assitance of infogram and Balsamiq. And ask and collect advice and suggestions from at least 3 friends. I will make some new datavisualization using raw data or redesign some of the exsisting data visualizations. 

Step 3: Final visualiztion. Use Tableau, Flourish and infogram to create final visualization.

Step 4: The final presentation will be created by shorthand, combining graphs, analysis and explanation.
