# Wireframes and storyboards
As outlined in part 1, I used "Shorthand" for storyboarding my story arc. The storyboard can be accessed at [here](https://preview.shorthand.com/EDe8pQdpObyUsVRo?_gl=1*118kgqf*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE2NDUwNDg4NTYuQ2owS0NRaUEzcktRQmhDTkFSSXNBQ1VFV19ZR1c5QjFhU1d3MUJWVVZsbEpZRnAyMkpHMUF5Wnp1bU41RnhoM0ZBa0dwNFhMRlZxSGlac2FBck9ZRUFMd193Y0I.)

# User research and interviews
## Target audience
Through this project, I intend to highlight the facts and reasons of so many stray dogs and cats in the U.S., and call on everyone to help stray cats and dogs and effectively reduce the number of stray cats and dogs in a humanistic way. This is not only conducive to the survival of cats and dogs, but also conducive to communites. Therefore, the target audience for my project is "everyone" in the U.S., since it need everyone's attention and effort, not only who has pet.

Identifying Interview Candidates In line with the description above of my target audience, I sought out individuals with different pet breeding situations, such as having dogs or cats now, have had dogs or cats before, never have dogs or cats. My aim was to get as much as the feedback from the audience of different pet breeding situations on my story. Whether they can understand my story? Wether they Can recognize the problem of a large number of stray cats and dogs and think after listening to the story? This was my initial thought process for selecting candidates. I reached out to friends and friends of friends here.
