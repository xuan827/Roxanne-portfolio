# Wireframes and storyboards
As outlined in part 1, I used "Shorthand" for storyboarding my story arc. The storyboard can be accessed at [here](https://preview.shorthand.com/EDe8pQdpObyUsVRo?_gl=1*fxpezk*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE2NDUwNDg4NTYuQ2owS0NRaUEzcktRQmhDTkFSSXNBQ1VFV19ZR1c5QjFhU1d3MUJWVVZsbEpZRnAyMkpHMUF5Wnp1bU41RnhoM0ZBa0dwNFhMRlZxSGlac2FBck9ZRUFMd193Y0I.)

# User research and interviews
## Target audience
Through this project, I intend to discuss who should be the savior of stray animals crisis in the U.S., and call on everyone to be the savior in available ways. This is not only conducive to the survival of cats and dogs, but also conducive to communites. Therefore, the target audience for my project is "everyone" in the U.S., since it need everyone's attention and effort, not just shelter, pet owner or who want to have a pet.

Identifying Interview Candidates In line with the description above of my target audience, I sought out individuals with different pet breeding situations, such as having dogs or cats now, have had dogs or cats before, never have dogs or cats. My aim was to get as much as the feedback from the audience of different pet breeding situations on my story. Whether they can understand my story? Wether they can recognize the stray animal crisis and want to be the savior as possible as they can after reading/listening to my story? This was my initial thought process for selecting candidates. I reached out to friends and friends of friends here.

Gender - All

Race - All

Age: All

Pet breeding situation: Any

Country live in: U.S.


| Question                                                     | Person1: <br />has dogs and cats now                         | Person2: <br />has had dogs  before                          | Person3: <br />never has cats or dogs                        | changes I will make                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Could you describe to me what this is telling you? Does this visualization tell a story?** | I can understand  the points of this story - the fact of  stray animal crisis and who can be its savior | The fact of  stray animal crisis in the U.S. and analyze the savior. This visualization is for awareness. | Discuss the savior of stray animal crisis. Everyone could be! |                                                              |
| **Who do you think is the intended audience?**               | People who are unaware of the problem of large numbers of stray dogs and cats | Who has pet and who want to have a dog or cat                | Everybody in the U.S.                                        |                                                              |
| **Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?L       | - Little confused about the skimming sequences in the section of two columns typesetting. I don't know whether I should look horizontally or vertically when you tell your story, especially when the explanation is not next to the diagram.<br />- The diagram of "people's attitude towards adoption", it is little hard to understand quickly since there are too colors and text. | - The graph of "people's attitude towards adoption" is not easy to understand without sufficient explanation | -Too complex of  graph of "people's attitude towards adoption". I can understand it after your explanation but too many colors and text make it difficult for me to understand in a short time. You can highlight the key points and simplify color matching. | - Modify graph "people's attitude towards adoption". All of them mentioned this graph is not easy to understand. I will try to simplify its color and make the text more obvious. I also will try to find more concise method to visulize this graph.<br />- Rearrange the typesetting to make the interpretation more closely connected with the diagram. Maybe I will make it one-column. |
| **Did you find the aesthetics soothing and complimentary or is there anything that you would like to change?** | - The background of the graph is white, but the background of storyboard is black, which is not uniform enough | - the text in some graphs are a little small                 | - Text in some graphs are not big enough and the color is too light | -Try to change the color of the storyboard or graph, making it much more uniform<br />-Enlarge text and make the color darker |
| **Is there enough persuasive information in the storyboard? Is this storyboard logical enough** | - "Owner Surrender" part mentions COVID-19, but there is a bit of a logical disconnect. Why suddenly only the COVID-19 was mentioned?  You may want to prove that it is generally believed that the COVID-19 is a core reason for owner surrender. This situation may be momentary, but in fact, owner surrender is a normalization problem. You can explain more to make it more logical.<br />- The explanation of pet lost is  a little bit convoluted. You can modify the explanation above the graph. | - The logic of pet lost is not easy to understand. But after your explanation, I can understand it quickly, therefore, you can modify the explanation to make it much clear. | - The graph "The number of lost pets has almost reached the maximum adoption capacity of the shelters" is not informtive.  Two stacks of dogs do not intuitively convey the message that the maximum capacity of the shelter is similar to the number of lost pets. | - I will rewrite the explanation of  COVID-19 part in Owner Surrender section, and clearly explain owner surrender is a normalization problem. It is not correct to think that the COVID-19 is a predisposing factor.<br />- Rewrite the explanation of pet lost, and make the number highlight. Also, I will redesign the graph, using one stack or simple table to present. |
| Is there anything would be changed and make it better        | - Some title of graph can be refined<br />                   | - In the part of the consequences of stray dogs and cats, you can give more concise examples and summarize them into a subtitle in short words, which makes it easier for the audience to realize the seriousness of the problem. | - The graph "Only 10% of the animals received in the shelter have been spayed otr neutered" is also not intuitive.    It not a obvious way to present the huge difference in the number of cats and dogs sterilized and not sterilized<br />-You can add the time on the graph"The top reasons for surrendering a pet are largely consistent both prior to COVID-19 and during" to make it more clear. | - Refine some titles of graphs<br />- Make the graph "Only 10% of the animals received in the shelter have been spayed otr neutered" into two stacks instead of one stack<br />-  Add the time on the graph"The top reasons for surrendering a pet are largely consistent both prior to COVID-19 and during"<br />- Divide "Adoption instead of purchase or support more for shelters"   into two suggestions "Adoption instead of purchase" and "Support more for shelters""<br />- Quote some news headlines and brief summaries of the tragic results of stray dogs and cats and their impact on the community, so that the audience can more intuitively realize that a large number of stray dogs and cats is indeed a problem worthy of attention |
| **Did you learn something ? Did this story invoke your thinking or inspire you to help stray dogs and pets?** | Yes! I learned a lot of things I didn't know before. But You can add something more specific and practical so that the audience can take action directly after listening to the story | I was aware of the fact that this is a problem but the facts and figures took me by surprise. | I don't really want to own pets, but maybe I want to help some shelters | - Add some button with link  under the suggestions. When audiences click the link, they will know how to help stray cats and dogs quickly. |
