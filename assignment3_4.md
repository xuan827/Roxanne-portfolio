# Test the solution
I selected two friends with different backgroud, one is interested in politics and sociology, and the other one only has some basic understanding。I want to test whether my visualization is easy to be understood by professionals and general audiences that only want to learn more about a new topic.

Friend 1:
He can correctly tell me what the visualization presents. And he think the intended audience will be dome politician, researchers and those who are interested in equality. There are some confusion and suggestion he pointed:
- the numbers "18.1%, 9.6..." are difficult to make him understand at once. And the percentage from 0% to 100% are also a little bit confusing. Why 45.5% becomes 0% to 100%? Is it much better to move the percentage from left side to right side?
- The black line between the two subgraphs was intended to explain 45.5%, but it may be misunderstood that it is the interpretation of the whole 36 cents。
- Is the gradient of red related to both discrimination and segregation？
- Different factors on the right are placed on the grid line, which is easy to misunderstand. You can remove the grid line on the right.
