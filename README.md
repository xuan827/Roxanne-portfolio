# About me
Hello, I am Ruoxuan Li, a second-year student from MSIT program. I am a combination of sensibility and rationality. On the one side, I pretty love art and always paint or visit some art museum in my spare time where I could enjoy the color, romance and sense of story. On the other side, I pay great attention to analyzing problems objectively. I believe visualization can be a combination of art and logic. We could explore a lot objective conclusion from data and gracefully present to the audience. 

I had some algorithm research experiecne, but I found I am much more interested in product management and decided to be a product manager after my graduation. I've worked as an product manager intern in Wechat for 6 months in last year, paticipating in design some data products and exploring demands using data. My current interest are in toB innovation, helping more companies make digital transformation. I am exporing more ways to discover requirements more effectively, design better product, and attract users.  


# What I hope to learn
In my previous experience, working as a product manager, I often need to present some conclusions with data and convince my audience. But it is always hard to choose the most effective visualization way. Moreover, I also need to design some data product, such as some dashboards. But I am lack of experience of designing clear and user-friendly dashboard. Aabove all, from this course, I hope to learn methods of using data to communicate and persuade my audience. And I also want to learn how to design a good data product with nice visualization interface.
